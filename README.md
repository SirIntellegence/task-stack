Task Stack is used to keep track of things you were doing. Were you interrupted by something more important? Push it to the stack. You can then pop it off later when you are done and read the reminder you placed for the task you were working on.

You build Task Stack with Netbeans (or at least I do). It should be very simple to set up, but you will need JDK 8+ to build it and Java 8+ to run it.
